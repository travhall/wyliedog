# Accessibility Guidelines

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

All components in the Wylie Dog Design System meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This ensures our interfaces are usable by people with diverse abilities and needs.

### Color Contrast
- **Text Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Non-text Contrast**: 3:1 minimum for interactive elements
- **Color Independence**: Never use color as the only means of conveying information

### Focus Management
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Logical tab order following visual layout
- Focus restoration after modal dialogs close
- Focus trapping in overlay components

## Keyboard Navigation

### Standard Interactions
- **Tab**: Move forward through interactive elements
- **Shift + Tab**: Move backward through interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close modals, menus, and overlays
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within menus, tabs, and other grouped controls

### Component-Specific Patterns
- **Menus**: Arrow keys for navigation, Enter to select
- **Tabs**: Arrow keys to change tabs, Tab to move to tab panel
- **Dialogs**: Focus trapped within dialog, Escape to close
- **Forms**: Tab between controls, Enter to submit

## Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Implementation
- Proper roles, states, and properties for all components
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Descriptive labels and instructions
- Semantic HTML structure

### Announcements
- State changes communicated to assistive technologies
- Error messages clearly associated with form controls
- Dynamic content updates announced appropriately
- Loading states and progress communicated

## Testing Guidelines

### Automated Testing
- All components tested with axe-core
- CI/CD pipeline includes accessibility checks
- Zero tolerance for automated test failures

### Manual Testing
- Keyboard-only navigation verification
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast validation
- Real-world usability assessment

### User Testing
- Include people with disabilities in testing
- Test with various assistive technologies
- Gather feedback on practical usability
- Address identified barriers promptly

## Implementation Checklist

For each component:
- [ ] ARIA roles and properties implemented correctly
- [ ] Keyboard interactions work as expected
- [ ] Focus management behaves appropriately
- [ ] Screen reader announcements are clear and helpful
- [ ] Color contrast meets minimum requirements
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Responsive design maintains accessibility
- [ ] Error states provide clear guidance
