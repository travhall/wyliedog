# Resources for Designers

Welcome to the Wylie Dog Design System! This guide will help you get started with using our design components and tokens effectively in your design workflow.

## Getting Started

### Figma UI Kit

Our Figma UI Kit contains all the components, design tokens, and patterns you need to create consistent designs.

**What's Included:**
- All UI components with variants and states
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Common page templates and layouts
- Icon library
- Pattern examples

**Access:** Request access from your design system team lead.

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are the foundation of our visual language. They ensure consistency across all designs and make it easy to maintain and update the system.

#### Color System
- **Primary colors:** Use for main actions, links, and brand elements
- **Neutral colors:** Use for text, backgrounds, and subtle elements
- **Semantic colors:** Use for success, warning, error, and info states
- **Always check contrast:** Ensure accessibility with proper color combinations

#### Typography Scale
- **Headings:** Use the defined heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
- **Body text:** Stick to the established text sizes and line heights
- **Font weights:** Use sparingly — typically normal (400) and semibold (600)

#### Spacing System
- **8px grid:** All spacing should follow multiples of 8px
- **Component spacing:** Use consistent padding and margins
- **Layout spacing:** Follow the spacing tokens for section gaps

## Working with Components

### Component States

Every interactive component has multiple states that need to be considered:

- **Default:** The standard appearance
- **Hover:** When a user hovers over the element
- **Focus:** When the element receives keyboard focus
- **Active/Pressed:** When the element is being interacted with
- **Disabled:** When the element is not interactive
- **Loading:** When an action is in progress

### Component Variants

Many components have multiple variants for different contexts:

- **Button variants:** Primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive
- **Badge variants:** Default, secondary, outline, destructive
- **Alert variants:** Default, destructive

Always choose the appropriate variant based on the component's purpose and hierarchy.

### Accessibility Considerations

Design with accessibility in mind from the start:

- **Color contrast:** Maintain minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text
- **Focus indicators:** Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states
- **Text alternatives:** Provide clear labels and descriptions
- **Touch targets:** Make interactive elements at least 44px × 44px

## Design Patterns

### Common UI Patterns

**Forms**
- Group related fields together
- Use clear labels and helpful placeholder text
- Provide immediate validation feedback
- Include clear error messages

**Data Tables**
- Make column headers clear and scannable
- Use zebra striping for better readability
- Include sorting and filtering when appropriate
- Provide pagination for large datasets

**Navigation**
- Keep navigation consistent across pages
- Highlight the current page/section
- Use breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies
- Ensure navigation is accessible on all devices

**Cards**
- Use cards to group related information
- Maintain consistent card structure
- Include clear actions when appropriate
- Consider card states (default, hover, selected)

### Layout Guidelines

**Grid System**
- Use a 12-column grid for desktop layouts
- Ensure responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Maintain consistent gutters and margins

**Content Hierarchy**
- Use typography scale to establish clear hierarchy
- Group related content with appropriate spacing
- Use visual weight to guide user attention

**White Space**
- Don't be afraid of white space — it improves readability
- Use consistent spacing between sections
- Maintain breathing room around important elements

## Design Process

### Before You Start

1. **Understand the requirements:** What problem are you solving?
2. **Check existing patterns:** Has this been solved before in the system?
3. **Consider the user journey:** How does this fit into the larger experience?
4. **Think mobile-first:** Ensure your design works on all screen sizes

### Design Workflow

1. **Start with low-fidelity:** Sketch out the basic structure and flow
2. **Use system components:** Build with existing components whenever possible
3. **Apply design tokens:** Use the established colors, typography, and spacing
4. **Add interactions:** Consider all component states and transitions
5. **Test and iterate:** Get feedback and refine your designs

### Handoff to Development

**What to Include:**
- Component specifications and measurements
- Interaction details and animations
- Asset exports in the correct formats
- Notes about responsive behavior
- Accessibility requirements

**Communication Tips:**
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Reference existing components when possible
- Explain any custom behaviors or interactions
- Be available for questions during implementation

## Tools and Resources

### Figma Plugins

**Recommended plugins for working with the design system:**
- **Design Tokens:** Sync tokens between Figma and code
- **Accessibility:** Check color contrast and other accessibility issues
- **Specs:** Generate specifications for developers
- **Icon Libraries:** Access to icon sets and illustrations

### Design Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your designs, check:

- [ ] All components use system tokens
- [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Interactive states are defined
- [ ] Responsive behavior is considered
- [ ] Text and labels are clear and concise
- [ ] Navigation and information hierarchy make sense
- [ ] Loading and error states are designed
- [ ] Components are properly named and organized
